# Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my work focused on exploring, analyzing, and visualizing data across various domains. Each project is a testament to my journey in harnessing the power of data to uncover insights and build predictive models.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains several projects, including:

- **Medical Data Analysis**: An in-depth look into medical datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- **Hurricane Analysis**: Analyzing patterns and impacts of hurricanes using historical data.
- **Medical Insurance Cost Prediction**: Employing machine learning models to predict insurance costs based on user data.
- **Linear Regression Models**: Building and tuning linear regression models for various predictive tasks.
- **Developer Trends Analysis**: Understanding trends within the developer community based on survey data.

Each project folder includes a detailed Jupyter notebook that walks through the analysis process, from data cleaning to visualization and modeling.

## Skills Demonstrated

Through these projects, I've developed and showcased skills in:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
